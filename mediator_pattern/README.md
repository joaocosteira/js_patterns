# Mediator Pattern
- Allows components to interact with each other via a mediator, instead of directly
- Analogy: Airplains
    * Instead of having the pilots talking to eachother while flying, there is the air traffic control, which is responsible for mediating and talking with each pilot, instead of having a massive group call between all the different pilots
