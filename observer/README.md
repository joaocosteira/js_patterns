- The observer Pattern is a subscription based pattern, which is allows you to subscribe and be notify based on certain events/modifications
- Important pieces:
    * **observers**  - list of observers that will be notified,
    * **subscribe** -  add to the observers list,
    * **unsubscribe** - remove from the observers list,
    * **notify** - notify all the observers
