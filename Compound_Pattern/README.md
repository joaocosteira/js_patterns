# Compound Pattern
- Multiple components that work together in order to perform a single task
- Sometimes components depend on each other (they have a shared state/logic etc)
- Examples: development of dropdowns/menues etc...
- compound pattern is great when you're building a component library.
- Exemple it is used in UI libraries like Semantic UI
